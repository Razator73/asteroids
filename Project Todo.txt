Polish Asteroids game (split code into multiple files)
    - Menu
        - Start Menu:
            [DONE] - Options: Start, High Scores, Quit
            - Ideas: controls menu, difficulty options, sounds (2.0)
                - controls menu with file to save configurations
        [DONE] - Game Over Menu: (1.3)
            [DONE] - Options: Play Again, Quit
            [DONE] - High Scores should be shown (highlight if last play was new top 5)
			[DONE] - Black out a rectangle
    - High Scores (save them, top 5 with name) (1.3)
        - new methods for displaying and input
        - free typing in pygame for name input?
		- include file in the .exe build
        [DONE] - score goes up every second and with shooting asteriods
    [DONE] - Split asteroids on impact (WIP,  change centers)
    [DONE] - Vary asteroid shape (polygons and not circles) (1.3)
        [DONE] - change the circle to list of ordered pairs (build from center to avoid rounding errors on points)
        [DONE] - check all lines for bullet collision
        [DONE] - save radius for spliting purposes
        [DONE] - create a finite number of shapes and give the asteriod on shape (moved to randomly generated)
    - Ramp up difficulty with score (leveling) (2.0)
    - Power up drops (decay over time) (start with just text) (2.0)
        - Spread shot (3 bullets +/- 15 degrees) --SS--
        - Rapid fire (2x speed rate and bullet speed) --RF--
        - Speed up (include rotational speed and acceleration) --SU--
        - Invulnerability (shield good for one hit) --SH--
        - Piercing shot (bullets don't disappear on contact) --PS--
    [DONE] - Run in .exe file
    [DONE] - Bullets take into account current ship velocity not just direciton
    - Figure out screen wrapping issues (bug) (1.3)
		[DONE] - sub obects connected to wrapped objects
		[DONE] - check for collision with sub objects
		- remove unneccesary sub objects to keep optimization up (done for asteroids need to do ship)
    [DONE] - Ship properties instead of attributes (updated the player class)
    - Ship explosion animation (2.0)
		- Base off of momentum of the asteriod that hit the ship
    - Sound effects (2.0)
    - Menu AI for background play (2.0)
    - [WIP] Optimize collision math (1.3)
		[DONE] - check proximity first (done for bullets and asteroids still needs to be done for the ship)
		- look into other algorithms for collision
